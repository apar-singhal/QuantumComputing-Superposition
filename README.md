# QuantumComputing-Superposition
First program in Q# for Quantum Computing

### Problem Statement:
Write a Q# operation that receives 2 boolean arrays and sets a qubit register in the corresponding superposition state.

For Example:

A = [1, 0, 1, 0]

B = [1, 1, 0, 1]

----------------

R = (|1010> + |1101>) / sqrt{2}
